# MLR
One of the most common types of predictive analysis is multiple linear regression. This type of analysis allows you to understand the relationship between a continuous dependent variable and two or more independent variables.

The independent variables can be either continuous (like age and height) or categorical (like gender and occupation). It's important to note that if your dependent variable is categorical, you should dummy code it before running the analysis.
